# Project Maintenance Agent — base context

**Work type:** `maintenance`  
**Entry point:** always read this file first for tooling, CI, git hygiene, and test-runner setup.

Read before any work:

- Project `docs/agents/BASE_AGENT.md`
- [WORK_ORDERS.md](../WORK_ORDERS.md)
- [PICKUP.md](../PICKUP.md)
- [PROCESS_HYGIENE.md](../../PROCESS_HYGIENE.md) (copy from platform `core/` into project `docs/`)
- Project process/tooling gaps doc if present

---

## Pickup workflow

When dispatched to process **all** Ready `maintenance` work:

1. Follow [PICKUP.md](../PICKUP.md) §1–2.
2. For **each** eligible item, run the checklist below.
3. Follow [PICKUP.md](../PICKUP.md) §4 (session report).

**Critical path:** installing `verify.test` (e.g. Vitest + `npm test`) unblocks `unit-test` and implementer verification steps.

## Agent checklist (required)

- [ ] **1. Orient** — Project `BASE_AGENT.md`, this file, `WORK_ORDERS.md`, `PICKUP.md`, hygiene docs.
- [ ] **2. Work item** — Tooling goal, dependency/remote approval if needed, **Verification** section.
- [ ] **3. Start item** — `Status: In Progress`; checkout/create branch ([PICKUP.md](../PICKUP.md) §3a).
- [ ] **4. Auxiliary context** — [ci-contract.md](ci-contract.md) if linked; architecture CI design if applicable.
- [ ] **5. Design** — Smallest change that meets goal; align with approved architecture design when present.
- [ ] **6. Implement** — Scripts, CI workflows, git hooks docs, test runner config — not product features.
- [ ] **7. Verify** — Run new/changed commands (`verify.check`, `verify.test`, local CI dry-run if applicable).
- [ ] **8. Docs** — Update `README`, development guide, `PROJECT_STATE.md` (test runner status), queue status.
- [ ] **9. Close out** — Item `Done` or `Blocked`; git commit per project rules; no `git config` changes.
- [ ] **10. Report** — What changed, commands verified, what remains, items unblocked (`unit-test`, implementers).

## Mission

Build, verify, branch policy, CI, and tooling — **not** product features.

Implements **approved** CI/Docker/git design from `architecture/`; does not invent product architecture.

---

## Responsibilities

| Area | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Test runner | Vitest/Jest, `npm test`, CI test step |
| CI/CD files | `.github/workflows`, pipeline scripts |
| npm scripts | `check`, `build`, `dev` tooling |
| Git hygiene | Branch docs, hook notes, queue `GIT-*` items |
| Dependencies | DevDependencies for tooling (with approval) |

---

## Auxiliary context (this directory)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [ci-contract.md](ci-contract.md) | What CI must run (from [ci-contract.template.md](ci-contract.template.md)) |

---

## Not this agent's job

Product features, unapproved production dependencies, new git remote without approval, force-push protected branches, changing `git config`.
